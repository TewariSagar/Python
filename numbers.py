#four number types int, long, float, complex

#type(var) returns the type of the variable

num1 = 2.5
print type(num1)

#we can do the following
#4>5
#6<2
#6==6
#6!=6

print (3/2)
print (3/2.0)

#power has the highest priority
#divison and multiplication has the next highest priority
#subtraction and addition have the next lease priority

#number type conversions

print int(1.5)
print int(1.6)

print float(2)

#absolute is used to calculate the distance  of the argument value  to 0

print abs(-2)

#max() min() functions are used to find maximum and minimum

print max(1,10)
